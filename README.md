# Embedding-a-Machine-Learning-Model-Into-A-GUI using GRADIO
In this project, I embeded a ML model into a web app to interact with it much easier, by inputing the required information, making predictions and showing the result.
This web application was built with Python and Gradio. It  predicts whether or not a customer will churn based on tenure, monthly charges, and total charges among others inputs. It uses a trained machine learning model built with scikit-learn to make the predictions.

## Installation and Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine

Install the required packages

Run the app with python app.py

Access the app by visiting http://localhost:7860

## Usage
Once the app is running, enter the necessary input features in the provided input fields to see the prediction results.
