# Embedding-a-Machine-Learning-Model-Into-A-GUI
In this project, I embeded a ML model into a web app to interact with it much easier, by inputing the required information, making predictions and showing the result.


# Customer Churn Prediction App using Gradio
This web application was built with Python and Gradio. It  predicts whether or not a customer will churn based on tenure, monthly charges, and total charges among others inputs. It uses a trained machine learning model built with scikit-learn to make the predictions.

# Sales Prediction App using Gradio
This is a simple web application built with Python and Streamlit that predicts the sales of products from a particular chain store.

## Installation and Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine

Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app with python app.py

Access the app by visiting http://localhost:7860

## Usage
Once the app is running, enter the necessary input features in the provided input fields to see the prediction results.

# Streamlit App for Product Sales Prediction
This is a Streamlit app that predicts the sales of products in a chain store. It is built with Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn. The app uses a trained regression model to make the predictions.

## Installation and Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine

Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app with streamlit run app.py

Access the app by visiting http://localhost:8501

Create your virtual environment using python -m venv env command in terminal.

Activate your environment using .\env\Scripts\activate command in terminal.

Install the different app requirements using :

pip install requirements -r streamlit_requirements.txt and/or

pip install requirements -r gradio_requirements.txt


## Usage
Once the app is running, select the necessary input features from the provided dropdowns and input fields to see the prediction results.
