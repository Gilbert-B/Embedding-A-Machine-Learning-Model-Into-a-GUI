# Embedding-a-Machine-Learning-Model-Into-A-GUI
In this project, I embeded a ML model into a web app to interact with it much easier, by inputing the required information, making predictions and showing the result.


# Customer Churn Prediction App using Gradio
This web application was built with Python and Gradio. It  predicts whether or not a customer will churn based on tenure, monthly charges, and total charges among others inputs. It uses a trained machine learning model built with scikit-learn to make the predictions.
